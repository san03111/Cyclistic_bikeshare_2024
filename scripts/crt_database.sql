===============================================================================
Create new database and schemas
===============================================================================
    This script will create a new database called "cyclistic_bikeshare". 
    - If the database already exists, it will be dropped first (âš  all data will be lost).
    - After creating the database, the script sets up three schemas:
        1. bronze  -> raw ingested data (unprocessed)
        2. silver  -> cleaned and standardized data
        3. gold    -> business-ready, aggregated, analytics data
